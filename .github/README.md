Legit could not have done any of this without Kestral being a god. W Kestral for allowing me to do this and helping along the way.



# Advanced Crosshair Overlay

This mod allows you to build/overlay your own custom crosshair (or any image you want) over the game.

## Usage

All customisation options are available through the mod's config file~ these include:

- Tinting the image, and modifying the opacity
- Changing the size of the image
- Changing the offset of the image from the center of the screen
- Whether to hide the default crosshair
- Whether to overlay or underlay the image relative to UI
- Whether the crosshair should be hidden in the main menu

You can change the active crosshair. To do so, place a png or jpeg image in the mod's install directory, and
change the config option `File name` to the name of the image (with extension).

## Crosshair Builder

Toggle off "Use Image Mode" to enable the builder

Scroll down and adjust values such as:

- Length | Length of each crosshair arm
- Rotation (not working) | Rotation of the crosshair in degrees
- Spacing (Gap) | Spacing between the center and each arm
- Width | Width of each crosshair arm or element
- Stroke (not working) | Stroke outline
- Stroke Color (not working) | Stroke color
- Color | Fill color for the builder crosshair
