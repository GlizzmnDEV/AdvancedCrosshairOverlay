 Crosshair Overlay

This mod allows you to overlay your own custom crosshair (or any image you want) over the game.

## Usage

All customisation options are available through the mod's config file~ these include:

- Tinting the image, and modifying the opacity
- Changing the size of the image
- Changing the offset of the image from the center of the screen
- Whether to hide the default crosshair
- Whether to overlay or underlay the image relative to UI
- Whether the crosshair should be hidden in the main menu

You can change the active crosshair. To do so, place a png or jpeg image in the mod's install directory, and
change the config option `File name` to the name of the image (with extension).

## Manual Installation Instructions

_(you should probably just use a mod manager like r2modman or gale though)_

!!! You need [Bepinex 5](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/latest) for mono !!!
(if you have no idea what the versions mean try BepInEx_win_x64_5.4.23.2 and it might work. maybe)

Once bepinex is installed, extract the contents of the zip into the BepInEx/plugins folder in the game's root directory.

have fun :3
